## CAIS++ Winter Curriculum Project: Sarcasm Detection in News Headlines Using NLP

### Summary
My project focuses on finetuning existing NLP models to aid in the task of sarcasm detection. With the growing influence of the internet in our lives, news articles and posts have become a lot of people's main source of information. Recognizing whether some of these sources are informational or serve as biased information or propaganda is crucial before trusting and formulating opinions on issues. Moving beyong news articles, sarcasm detection is important in understanding natural human language, as it is commonly used in everyday language. As a result, I aim to **improve the accuracy of a finetuned NLP deep learning network** in order to reliably detect sarcasm in the written information around us. 

### Dataset
The dataset I used to train my model was Kaggle's **News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection** data set. The data set's columns include the news headline, the article URL, and a value denoting its sarcasm (1 for sarcastic and 0 for not sarcastic). There was not a lot of processing that had to be done, as the data was designed specifically for the task the model was trying to achieve. The data covered a variety of articles, and it provided a strong training set for the task of sarcasm detection. After converting the JSON into a dataframe, the model was ready to train.
